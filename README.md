# About Project
With the advancement of engineering with technology, it has become common to combine various electronic and mechanical devices. The use of technological equipment is becoming more frequent and facilitates the day to day bringing comfort and convenience. In this way, this is a microcontrolled board of universal automation, with greater mobility, safety and low cost. The VTRON consists of a board and a mobile application, capable of receiving commands from a mobile device that performs tasks such as turning the vehicle on and off, alarm, headlights, opening the trunk, locking and unlocking the doors and blowing the horn. The project can be used in vehicles, home automation and also as a tool in Teaching Educational Robotics. With the objective of developing a mobile application and a smart, low cost prototype system, which allows the user to interact with his or her vehicle and to be able to perform preprogrammed actions. The developed system proved to be functional obtained all the positive expectations because the board and the application worked as expected giving accessibility to the functions of the vehicle and the residence.
